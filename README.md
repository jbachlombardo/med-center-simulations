# med-center-simulations

Med center process flow simulations for ISP:

- 1_ (28/4)
  - Queueing model using normal distributions and estimated times by math
  - Simulation model using normal distributions, hourly approach
- 2_ (29/4)
  - Simulation model using skewed distributions, manually moved forward on minute basis to understand period-by-period patient movement
  - Simulation model using skewed distributions, looped over a single step
- 3_ (30/4)
  - Simulation model using skewed distributions, looped over multiple steps in notebook -- single simulation with visualisation
  - Simulation model using skewed distributions, looped over multiple steps in terminal -- n_simulations with mean results from simulations
